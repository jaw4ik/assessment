@CUDExperience
Feature: CUDExperience
	As an author I can create new set of learner's experience settings and save it in form of Experience,
	 so I could build package with same set of settings several times if I need.
	As an author I can update set of learner's experience settings in existing Experience,
	 so I could build package with some specific setting adjusted.
	As an author I can delete exisitng Experience, so I do not keep not needed sets of settings.
