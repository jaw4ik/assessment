Feature: PackageProgressScore
	- Effective score for each question = score of the last attempt for this question;
	- Learner’s score for current question is calculated by this rule (all options have the same weight):
		-- (Number of checked options that are correct + Number of not checked options that are incorrect)/(Number of answer options)×100% ;
	- Learner can see his progress summary (in percent) : overall experience progress value = arithmetical mean of all progress values of objectives, progress value per objective;
