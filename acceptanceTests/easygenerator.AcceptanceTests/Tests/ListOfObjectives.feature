| Objective3 |
Then objectives tiles list contains items with data 
| Title      |
| Objective1 |
| Objective2 |
| Objective3 |


Scenario: Objectives are sorted by title ascending by default
Given objectives are present in database
| Title       |
| Objective_a |
| a_Objective |
| Objective_z |
| 1_Objective |
| _Objective  |
Then objectives tiles list consists of ordered items
| Title       |
| _Objective  |
| 1_Objective |
| a_Objective |
| Objective_a |
| Objective_z |
And objectives list order switch is set to 'ascending'

Scenario: Objectives are sorted by title descending if set descending order
Given objectives are present in database
| Title       |
| Objective_a |
| a_Objective |
| Objective_z |
| 1_Objective |
| _Objective  |
When I switch objectives list order to 'ascending'
And I switch objectives list order to 'descending'
Then objectives tiles list consists of ordered items
