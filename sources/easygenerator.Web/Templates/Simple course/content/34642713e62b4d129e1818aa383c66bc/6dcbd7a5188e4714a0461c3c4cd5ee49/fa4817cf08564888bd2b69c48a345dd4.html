<h3><strong>Dating the Crestworth and Mathmos company&rsquo;s</strong></h3>

<p>The &ldquo;Astro&rdquo; and &ldquo;Astro Baby&rdquo; were the first two lava lamps launched in 1963 and 1964 respectively. Edward and his wife Christine Craven Walker ran the business very successfully from 1963 on through the 1960s and &lsquo;70s.</p>

<p>Edward and his wife Christine Craven Walker wanting to retire teamed up with young entrepreneurs Cressida Granger and David Mulley in 1989. Over a period of years Granger and Mulley bought the business from the Craven-Walkers and successfully launched the lava lamp to a new generation. Part of the relaunch included changing the company name from Crestworth to Mathmos in 1992.</p>

<p>The word Mathmos is taken from the cult 1960s film Barbarella. Millions of lava lamps were manufactured in Dorset in the 1990s and sold throughout the world gaining a host of business and marketing awards including two Queens Awards for Export.</p>
