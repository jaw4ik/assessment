<p>A lava lamp has showings with a slow, rolling effect of the lava solids as they appear to slowly heat, shift, and position before transforming into the world famous shape mutations, gently rising and falling for several minutes then eventually subsiding and returning to rest at the bottom of the lamp until the next showing.</p>

<p>What is the interval of these showings?</p>
