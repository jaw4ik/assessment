<p><strong>Where does the name come from?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Craven-Walker originally developed the lava lamp from a design for an egg timer he saw in a Dorset pub. Taking years to develop the formula original models were made with orange squash bottles and the first lava lamp came to market in 1963. The name lava lamp originates from the fact that appearance of the wax is suggestive of Pāhoehoe lava. Another, more technical name is liquid motion lamp.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Astro&rdquo; and &ldquo;Astro Baby&rdquo; were the first two lava lamps launched in 1963 and 1964 respectively. They were an instant hit and became one of the defining products of the swinging &lsquo;60s appearing in cult TV series &#39;&#39;The Prisoner&quot; and &quot;Dr.Who&quot;.&nbsp; Edward and his wife Christine Craven-Walker ran the business very successfully through the 1960s and &lsquo;70s. Rights to several countries including the US were sold in the 1960s for the duration of the patents; these expired with the patents in the 1980s.</p>
