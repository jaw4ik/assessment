<p>The &ldquo;Astro&rdquo; and &ldquo;Astro Baby&rdquo; were the first two lava lamps launched in 1963 and 1964 respectively. Edward and his wife Christine Craven Walker ran the business very successfully from 1963 on through the 1960s and &lsquo;70s. Rights to several countries including the US were sold in the 1960s for the duration of the patents, these expired with the patents in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Edward and his wife Christine Craven Walker wanting to retire teamed up with young entrepreneurs Cressida Granger and David Mulley in 1989. Over a period of years Granger and Mulley bought the business from the Craven-Walkers and successfully launched the lava lamp to a new generation. Part of the relaunch included changing the company name from Crestworth to Mathmos in 1992.</p>
