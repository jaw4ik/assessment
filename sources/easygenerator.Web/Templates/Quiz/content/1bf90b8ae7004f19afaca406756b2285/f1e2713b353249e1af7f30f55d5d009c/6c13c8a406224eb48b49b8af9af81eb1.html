<p>The &ldquo;Astro&rdquo; and &ldquo;Astro Baby&rdquo; were the first two lava lamps that Edward and his wife Christine Craven Walker launched in 1963 and 1964 respectively. They were an instant hit and became one of the defining products of the swinging &lsquo;60s appearing in cult TV series &#39;&#39;The Prisoner&quot; and &quot;Dr.Who&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
