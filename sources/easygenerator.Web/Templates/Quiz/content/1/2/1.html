<div>In version 8 of easygenerator we have added some great functionality that will impact the effectiveness of your e-Learning. With easygenerator, quiz questions and assessments can be tied to learning objectives and the course navigation will automatically change, based on the outcome per assessment. A learner can strengthen her understanding of a weak subject accordingly and skip the parts where competence has been achieved. The progress is also measured per objective, giving the learner a clear understanding of the results of her efforts.</div>
