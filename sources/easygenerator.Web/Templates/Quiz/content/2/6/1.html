    The fact that easygenerator is an online platform is the heart of our collaborative platform. Everybody from anywhere can login at any time and contribute to the development. We even have an external review facility for people who don&#39;t have an easygenerator license.

<div>Keeping the development process smooth becomes harder when more people are involved, therefore we added workflow facilities. But in the spirit of our platform we kept them very simple. There are three elements in the workflow. You can place comments on each page (plus view and react on comments of others), you can create a task for a page and assign that to yourself or someone else and you have a task list with an overview of all tasks assigned to you. That&#39;s all quite simple but very effective.</div>
