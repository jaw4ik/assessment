    People with different roles need different facilities. We have implemented a rights and role system that arranges this. If you have a subject matter expert with little to no knowledge of e-Learning you can assign the role of &#39;content editor&#39; to him. He will only be able to edit existing pages (text and images). An extra advantage is that he will only see the functionality that he needs. This way it is possible for him to start his work with no or very little (5 minutes) instruction. In total we support seven different roles, with specific rights.</div>
