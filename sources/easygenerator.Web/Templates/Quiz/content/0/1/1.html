<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ease of use is very important for an authoring tool; this becomes even more important since subject matter experts participate more and more in the development process. For easygenerator this is one of our main focal points. That makes sense when your name is easygenerator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One of the reasons easygenerator is so easy to use, is our intuitive interface. You don&#39;t need a three day course. Probably the most important thing is the What You See Is What You Get Editor. As an author you work in an e-Learning module that shows exactly the same representation as the learner sees, the only difference is that an author can edit. Thanks to this, you always know what you are doing and what the effects of your actions are for the learner.</div>
