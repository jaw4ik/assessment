<p><strong>The lava lamp</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lava lamp (or Astro lamp) is a decorative novelty item, invented by British accountant Edward Craven-Walker in 1963. The lamp contains blobs of colored wax inside a glass vessel filled with clear liquid; the wax rises and falls as its density changes due to heating from an incandescent light bulb underneath the vessel. The appearance of the wax is suggestive of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xExdEXOaA9A">pāhoehoe lava</a>, hence the name. The lamps are designed in a variety of styles and colours.</p>
