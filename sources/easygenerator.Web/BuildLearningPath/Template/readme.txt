Quick manual on how to host an easygenerator learning path on your web hosting:

1. What You Need
Before you can upload your learning path to the internet, you need a web hosting service. Web hosts provide a place on the internet where you can put up a website or other content  like eLearning courses, so that everyone can see it. Think of it like a folder on your computer where you keep your website files. 

2. Uploading
Once you have a web hosting account and a domain name, you are ready to copy your learning path files from your computer to the web server. This is done either by means of a control panel in your hosting account, or with a program called ftp. Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything to your hosting.

3. Get a Public Link
Next, we need to get a public link to the main learning path HTML file you have uploaded - "index.html". To do this, copy the path to the "index.html" and use the following pattern to create the link: "http://www.yourwebsite.com/path_to_the_folder/index.html". 

After doing this, the online link to the main page of your learning path can be shared with your learners through the internet.
