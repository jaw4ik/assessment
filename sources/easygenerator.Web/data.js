For easygenerator this is one of our main focal points. That makes sense when your name is easygenerator.<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>One of the reasons easygenerator is so easy to use, is our intuitive interface. You don&#39;t need a three day course. Probably the most important thing is the What You See Is What You Get Editor. As an author you work in an e-Learning module that shows exactly the same representation as the learner sees, the only difference is that an author can edit. Thanks to this, you always know what you are doing and what the effects of your actions are for the learner.<\/div>"

We made the toolbars adjustable. You can now hide them or place them in your preferred location. Enabling you to create the interface you want. Another improvement is that you can expand and collapse the table of content, making almost your entire screen available for editing. These are small but important changes. We added a big change too: our rights and role model. The idea is that each user only sees the functions that he needs, making the interface even more easy to use. We have seven different roles, from a reviewer up to an administrator.<\/div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n<div>And yet, at the same time easygenerator is a very powerful tool. You can embed audio, video, animations, YouTube videos and even external media with ease. You can create complex branching scenarios (based on learning outcomes) without programming and develop custom functionality with easygenerator&#39;s open API.<\/div>"
